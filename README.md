# Predicting Crime Case Resolutions Using Machine Learning

## Project Information
This repository contains the implementation and analysis for predicting whether reported crime cases are **resolved** or **remain under investigation** using machine learning.

## Dataset Used
- **Source:** Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD)
- **Platform:** Los Angeles Open Data Portal
- **Dataset:** Crime Data from 2020 to Present  
- **Link:** https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8

## Repository Contents
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebooks  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Baseline and advanced machine learning models  
- Model evaluation and SHAP interpretability  
- Final academic report

## Results Summary
- **Best Model:** LightGBM  
- **Primary Metric:** ROC-AUC (~0.86)  
- Contextual and operational crime features were the strongest predictors

## Future Work and Limitations
- Limitations and ethical considerations are discussed in the report  
- Future work and real-world deployment recommendations are provided in detail

## How to Use
1. Read the **report** for methodology, conclusions, and future work  
2. Explore the **notebooks** to understand implementation details
